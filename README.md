# 🔐 Mini Encrypt Decrypt

A simple Python mini-project for **text encryption and decryption** using a custom algorithm.  
This project is perfect for **beginners** who want to practice Python basics like:
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Strings
- ASCII conversions (`ord` & `chr`)

---

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypt any text with a simple algorithm.
- Decrypt the encrypted text back to the original.
- Menu-based interface for easy use.
- Runs directly in the terminal.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works
- **Encryption**: Each character → converted to ASCII → multiplied by `2` → `+5` → converted back to a character.  
- **Decryption**: Reverse process → subtract `5` → divide by `2` → convert back to the original character.
